## CS-499 Capstone
Throughout my classes at SNHU, I've been constantly learning new programming skills and best practices. In order to best showcase my development as a programmer, I picked some projects from previous classes which had the purpose of getting some first hands-on experience with certain programming principles, and expanded upon and enhanced them with the knowledge that I now have towards the end of obtaining my degree. I found the most interest in back-end and full-stack development, as well as creating code that efficiently handles large quantities of data, and wanted my enhancements to reflect that.
