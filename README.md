## CS-499 Capstone
Throughout my classes at SNHU, I've been constantly learning new programming skills and best practices. To best showcase my development as a programmer, I picked some projects from previous classes that had the purpose of getting some first hands-on experience with certain programming principles and expanded upon and enhanced them with the knowledge that I now have towards the end of obtaining my degree. I found the most interest in back-end and full-stack development, as well as creating code that efficiently handles large quantities of data, and wanted my enhancements to reflect that.

In my original dashboard project for my Client/Server Development class, I developed a program that read contents from a CSV file hosted on MongoDB and displayed the contents of the database through a front-end application using Python's Dash. A database manipulation script was also created to allow users to create, read, update, and delete entries in the database. Looking back at the original project (Pictured below), it looked fairly rough, and I was no longer able to access the database that was hosted on an SNHU server. I wanted the dashboard to represent product listings of various fragrances and wanted the data to be as up-to-date as possible. To accomplish this, I created a data scraping model in Python using BeautifulSoup. I used the online retailer Perfumania as a source for my data. The data scraping model is present in the Dashboard Enhancements folder of my repository. I also wanted the front-end aspect of the website to look cleaner and more professional, as well as display data visualizations that provide insight into the products presented.

### Database Enhancements
My second artifact of improvement was my data structure loader. In my Data Structures & Algorithms class, I made an application that loaded the contents of a CSV file into a data structure of our choosing that we believed would best fit the use case of our class scenario. For my enhancements, I wanted to go a step further and allow users to choose what data structure they wanted to load their data into and display the time it took for each data structure to be loaded and have the contents displayed. The purpose of this is to have an easy visualization of the complexity of different data structures and how efficient each of them is at performing various tasks. I decided to have this program read the contents of my scraped fragrance CSV file instead of the previously provided data from my previous class.

Going back and enhancing some of my previous work really was a pleasant experience, and was satisfying being able to improve previous projects with the knowledge I have now. These enhancements helped me take core concepts that I learned from previous classes and allowed me to expand them into applying them to more realistic, business-applicable applications. I look forward to continuing to evolve and continue learning as I continue through my coding journey.
